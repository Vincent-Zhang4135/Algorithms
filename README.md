# Algorithms

A series of algorithms implemented after taking a proof based class on the Theory of Algorithms:

Implemented Gale-Shapleyâ€™s Matching, Interval Scheduling, A\* Shortest Path, Merge Sort, Max subarray, Needle-Wunsch,
Knapsack, Sudoku Solver algorithm, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Search, Heap Sort, and more

Utilized algorithmic paradigms including: Greedy approach, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Divide & Conquer, DFS
and BFS, and utilized data structures like stacks, queues, min/max-heaps, binary trees, matrices, and hash maps (dictionaries).
